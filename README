----
Prime numbers sieve implementations using CSP channels in Go.
----

./sieve1.go    Taken from the Go language tutorial, worse than trial division

./sieve2.go    Eratosthenesque, simple implementation

./sieve3.go    Eratosthenesque, with wheel optimization and more efficient
		   implementations of `PeekChHeap` and `sendproxy`, the result is
		   about 4x faster than ./sieve2.go

I wrote about it here: <http://blog.onideas.ws/eratosthenes.go>.
